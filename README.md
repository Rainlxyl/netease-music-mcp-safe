# NetEase Music MCP — safe deployment edition

An authenticated, read-only-by-default MCP server for connecting ChatGPT or Codex to a NetEase
Cloud Music account. It is derived from
[Vael-KY/netease-music-mcp](https://github.com/Vael-KY/netease-music-mcp) under the MIT license.

## Safety changes

- Bearer-token authentication is mandatory; the server refuses to start without it.
- Read-only mode is enabled by default and hides all account-changing tools.
- Local use binds to `127.0.0.1` by default.
- Public wildcard CORS is removed.
- Inputs, request sizes and upstream responses are validated.
- Cookies are read only from environment variables and are never returned by `/health`.
- Destructive tools are clearly identified and require `MCP_READ_ONLY=false`.

## Available tools

Read-only mode provides search, playlist listing, playlist contents, play history and daily
recommendations. Read-write mode additionally provides playlist creation, track addition/removal,
and like/unlike.

## Local development

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill it locally. Do not commit `.env`.
2. Export the variables using a method appropriate for your shell.
3. Run `python server.py`.
4. Check `http://127.0.0.1:3456/health`.

Run the test suite without NetEase credentials:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

## Zeabur

Deploy the repository as a Python service with these settings:

- Root directory: repository root
- Start command: `python server.py`
- Port: supplied through Zeabur's `PORT` variable (see `zbpack.json`)
- Health endpoint: `/health`

Set the following environment variables in Zeabur's dashboard, never in Git:

- `NETEASE_COOKIE`: `MUSIC_U=...; __csrf=...`
- `MCP_ACCESS_TOKEN`: a random secret of at least 24 characters
- `MCP_READ_ONLY`: keep `true` for the first deployment
- `MCP_HOST`: `0.0.0.0`

The MCP endpoint will be `https://YOUR-SERVICE.zeabur.app/mcp`.

## Important limitations

This project calls undocumented NetEase web endpoints. They may change, expire, or trigger account
risk controls. Test read-only tools first. A NetEase cookie grants account access: do not paste it
into a chat, commit it, place it in screenshots, or expose it in logs.
